/*
In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer.
js provides eight different data types wich are:
undefined
null
boolean
string
symbol
bigint
number
object
*/

/*
Varibles: allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion.
They do this by using a "labeel" to a point to the data
rather than using tje data itself. Any of the eight data types may be stored in variables.

Variables are similar to the "x" and "y" variables you use in mathematics, wich means they're
a simple name to represent the data we want to refer to. Computer variables differ from
mathematical variables in that they can store different values at different values at different
times.

We tell javascript to create or "declare" a variable by putting the keyword "var"
in front of it, like so:
*/
var ourName;

var myName;

/*
In js we end statements with semicolons with semicolons " ; "
Bariable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and " $ " or " _ ", but may not containt
spaces or start with a number.
