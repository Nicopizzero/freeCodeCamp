Elements of Python:

* Vocavulary / Words - Variables and Reserved words (Chapter 2):
Reserved Words:
* You cannot use RESERVER WORDS as Variable anmes / indetifiers

False   class   return  is      finally
None    if      for     lambda  continue
True    def     from    while   nonlocal
and     del     global  not     with
as      elif    try     or      yield
assert  else    import  pass
break   expect  in      raise

Sentences or Lines:
x = 2       <-- Assignment statement
x = x + 2   <-- Assignment with expression
print(x)    <-- Print statement

x        - variable
=        - operator
2        - Constant
print( ) - Reserved Word / Function






* Sentence structure - valid syntax patterns (Chapter 3-5)
* Story structure - constructing a program for a purpose


Programming Paragraphs / Scripts

Python Scripts:

* Interactive Python is good for experiments and programms of 3-4 lines long.

* Most programs are much longer, so we type them into a file and tell Python to run the commands in the file.

* In a sense, we are "giving Python a script".

* As a convention, we add ".py" as the suffix on the end of these files to indicate they contain Python.

Interactive vversus Script

* Interactive:
- You type directly to Python one line at a time and it responds

* Script:
- You enter a sequence of statements (lines) into a file using text editor and tell Python to execute
  the statement in the file

Program Steps of Program Flow:
* Like a recipe or installation instructions, a program is a sequence of steps to be done in order.
* Some steps are CONDITIONAL - they may be skipped.
* Sometimes a step or group of steps is to be repeated.
* Sometimes we store a set of steps to be used over and over as needed several places throughout the program (Chapter 4)

Sequential Steps:
When a program is running, it flows from one step to the next. As programmers, we set up "paths" fot the program
to follow.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conditional Steps:
Let's only do this step if something is true.
* The synatx we tend to use here is the reserved word "if"
The "if" is like a little fork in the road(you can go one way or you can go another way)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Repeated Steps (Loops):
Loops (repeated steps) have ITERATION VARIABLES that change each time through a loop.
"while"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

dict() - Dictionary
for -  Another form of loop
if  -  Conditional
