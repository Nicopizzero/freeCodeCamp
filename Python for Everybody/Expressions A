Constants:
* Fixed values suah as numbers, letters, and strings, are called "constants" because theur value does not change
* Numeric constants are as you expect
* String constants use single quotes (') or double quotes (")

Reserved Words:
* You cannot use RESERVER WORDS as Variable anmes / indetifiers

False   class   return  is      finally
None    if      for     lambda  continue
True    def     from    while   nonlocal
and     del     global  not     with
as      elif    try     or      yield
assert  else    import  pass
break   expect  in      raise

Variables:
* A variable is a named plce in the memory where a programmer can store data and later retrieve the data using the
variable "name"
* Programmers get to choose the names of the variables
* You can change the content of a variable in a later statement

Python Variable Name Rules:
* Must start with a letter or underscore ( _ )
* Must consist of letters, numbers, and underscores
* Case Sensitive ()
Good:      spam - eggs - spam23 - _speed (dont use this one unless we were actually doing it because Python tod us to use)
Bad:       23spam - #sign - var12
Different: spam - Spam - SPAM

Mnemonic Variable Names
* Since we programmers are given a choice in how we choose our variable names, there is a bit of "best practice"
* We name variables to help us remember what we intend to store in them ("mnemonic" = "memory aid")
* This can confuse beginning students because well-named variables often "sound" so good that they must be keywords

Assignment Statements:
* We assing a value to a variable using the assignment statement (=)
* As assignment statement consists of an expression on the right-hand side and a variable to store the result.
x = 3.9 * x * (1 - x)




=   - assignment statement
