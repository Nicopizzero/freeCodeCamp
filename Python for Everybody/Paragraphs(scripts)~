Programming Paragraphs / Scripts

Python Scripts:

* Interactive Python is good for experiments and programms of 3-4 lines long.

* Most programs are much longer, so we type them into a file and tell Python to run the commands in the file.

* In a sense, we are "giving Python a script".

* As a convention, we add ".py" as the suffix on the end of these files to indicate they contain Python.

Interactive vversus Script

* Interactive:
- You type directly to Python one line at a time and it responds

* Script:
- You enter a sequence of statements (lines) into a file using text editor and tell Python to execute
  the statement in the file
